## üéØ Problem Statement

Healthcare organizations generate vast amounts of data, but extracting actionable insights and predicting key operational metrics like patient Length of Stay remains a challenge. This project aims to:

- Analyze patient data to understand demographic distributions, common medical conditions, and billing patterns.
- Identify key trends in patient admissions and their impact on hospital operations.
- Develop a predictive model for Length of Stay to assist in resource allocation, discharge planning, and improving operational efficiency.

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted using Python in Google Colab to understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and prepare the data for modeling.

### Data Overview

- 55,500 patient records with 17 features.
- No missing values‚Äîclean dataset.

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Converted date columns to datetime objects.
- Calculated **Length of Stay (LoS)** in days:  
  `(Discharge Date - Date of Admission)`
- Negative LoS values (data errors) set to NaN, then filled with median LoS.
- Extracted time-based features: Admission Year, Month, Day of Week.
- Created Age Group bins (e.g., '18-24', '25-34', '80+').

### Key Univariate Insights

- **Age:** Broadly distributed across adult age groups.
- **Billing Amount & LoS:** Uniform distribution, suggesting diverse patient cases.
- **Gender:** Higher proportion of Female patients, followed by Male and Non-binary.
- **Medical Conditions:** Hypertension, Diabetes, and Obesity most prevalent.
- **Admission Types:** Balanced across Elective, Urgent, and Emergency.
- **Test Results:** Majority are 'Abnormal' or 'Inconclusive'.

### Key Bivariate Insights

- **Average Billing & LoS:** Consistent across medical conditions, admission types, and genders.
- **Test Results by Medical Condition:**  
  - Hypertension & Obesity: Predominantly 'Abnormal'
  - Arthritis: Higher proportion of 'Normal'
- **Monthly Admissions:** Stable trend, no significant seasonal spikes.

## ü§ñ Predictive Modeling: Length of Stay Prediction

A machine learning model was developed to predict Length of Stay (regression problem).

- **Target Variable:** Length of Stay
- **Features Used:** Age, Gender, Medical Condition, Blood Type, Admission Type, Medication, Test Results, Insurance Provider, Hospital, Admission Year, Admission Month, Admission Day of Week
- **Preprocessing:** One-Hot Encoding via ColumnTransformer within a Pipeline
- **Model:** XGBoost Regressor (`xgb.XGBRegressor`)
- **Train/Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 7.55 days
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 8.71 days
- **R-squared (R¬≤):** -0.01

---

### Model Performance Discussion

The R-squared value of **-0.01** indicates that the current model's predictive capability is not yet robust, performing below a simple baseline model that would predict the average Length of Stay for all patients. This suggests that predicting Length of Stay is a complex challenge with the current dataset and features.

**Potential reasons for this initial performance:**
- The inherent variability and complexity of patient Length of Stay, influenced by numerous uncaptured factors (e.g., comorbidities, treatment complications, physician practices, hospital resource availability).
- Need for more advanced feature engineering or inclusion of additional, highly relevant data points.
- Initial hyperparameter settings for the XGBoost model might not be optimal.

Despite this, the modeling process successfully identified key features influencing the predictions, providing valuable insights for future improvements.

### Feature Importance

Despite the low R¬≤, analyzing feature importance provides insights into which variables the model attempted to leverage:

- **Top Predictors:** Insurance Provider (Medicare, Cigna), Test Results_Abnormal, Medical Condition (Asthma)
- **Hospital and Time Factors:** Hospital names and Admission Month (January, November, June)
- **Other Relevant Features:** Medication_Lipitor, Blood Type (O+, AB-), Age

This analysis suggests that while these features hold some individual predictive signal, the overall model needs further refinement to better capture the complex relationships within the data.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the healthcare data. The dashboard consists of three main pages:

### 1. Patient Demographics

- Overview of patient counts, average age, billing, and length of stay
- Distribution by Age Group and Gender
- Test Results distribution by Age Group for selected medical conditions
- Top hospitals by patient count
- Filtering by Medical Condition, Month, and Year

### 2. Key Trends

- Trends in Admitted Patients, Avg Length of Stay, and Avg Billing Amount over time
- Breakdown by Day Type (Weekday/Weekend) and Length of Stay categories
- Monthly and daily admission breakdown tables

### 3. Treatment & Cost

- Total Billing Amount by Length of Stay and Admission Type
- Total Billing Amount by Hospital and Insurance Provider
- Prescription patterns for different Medical Conditions

---

## üí° Key Findings & Recommendations

- **Prevalent Conditions:** Hypertension, Diabetes, and Obesity are most common‚Äîtargets for public health initiatives.
- **Consistent Costs & Stays:** Average billing and LoS are consistent across conditions, genders, and admission types‚Äîwarrants further investigation.
- **Distinct Test Result Patterns:** Strong relationship between Medical Condition and Test Results (e.g., Hypertension/Obesity: 'Abnormal'; Arthritis: 'Normal').
- **Hospital-Specific Influences:** Certain hospitals have higher patient volumes and unique influences on LoS.
- **LoS Prediction Challenges & Future Direction:** Feature importance analysis provides guidance; future efforts should focus on enriching the dataset and applying advanced modeling techniques.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Create interaction terms (e.g., Age √ó Medical Condition), or features from external data (e.g., socioeconomic factors).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for XGBoost.
- **Outlier Analysis & Treatment:** Deeper analysis of outliers in Billing Amount and LoS.
- **Alternative Models:** Try LightGBM, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.
- **Interactive Mapping:** Integrate an interactive map (e.g., Folium, Power BI map visuals) for hospital locations and patient distribution.
- **Deployment Simulation:** Plan for deploying the LoS prediction model as a web service (e.g., Flask/Streamlit).
